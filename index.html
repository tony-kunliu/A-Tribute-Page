          <h3>Here's a time line of Mr Yuan's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1930</strong> - Born in Beijing, China</li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong> - He graduated from the Southwest Agriculture Institute in 1953 and began his teaching career at an agriculture school in Anjiang, Hunan Province.</li>
            <li><strong>1960s</strong> - He came up with an idea for hybridizing rice in the 1960s, when a series of natural disasters and inappropriate policies (the Great Leap Forward) had plunged China into an unprecedented famine that caused many deaths.</li>
            <li><strong>1964</strong> - he happened to find a natural hybrid rice plant that had obvious advantages over others. Greatly encouraged, he began to study the elements of this particular type.The biggest problem by then, was having no known method to reproduce hybrid rice in mass quantities, and that was what Yuan set out to solve. In 1964, Yuan created his theory of using the probably-existing naturally-mutated male-sterile rice individuals for the creation of reproductive hybrid rice species, and in two years he managed to find a few individuals of such male-sterile rice that he predicted could be used for his research. Subsequent experiments proved his theory feasible, which was his most important </li>        
                  
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - he found an important species of wild rice that he needed for the creation of high-yield hybrid rice species. In 1973, in cooperation with others, he was finally able to establish a complete process of creating and reproducing high-yield hybrid rice species.</li>      
            <li><strong>1971</strong> - The next year they successfully cultivated a type of hybrid rice species which had great advantages. It yielded 20 percent more per unit than that of common ones, putting China in the lead worldwide in rice production. For this achievement, he was dubbed the "Father of Hybrid Rice."</li>        
            <li><strong>1999</strong> - The "Super Rice" Yuan is now working on has yields 30 percent higher than those of common rice. A record yield of 17,055 kilograms per hectare was registered in Yongsheng County in Yunnan Province.</li>
            <li><strong>2014</strong> - In January 2014, Yuan said in an interview that genetically modified food is the future direction of food and that he had been working on genetic modification of rice.</li>    
           
          </ul>
